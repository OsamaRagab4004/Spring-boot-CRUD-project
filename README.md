## Features
* User registration and login with JWT authentication
* Password encryption using BCrypt
* Role-based authorization with Spring Security
* Customized access denied handling
* Logout mechanism
* Refresh token
* sending emails to the user using smtp.gmail.com

## Technologies
* Spring Boot 3.0
* Spring Security
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* BCrypt
* Maven
* Database: The application uses an H2 database by default. For production, configure your preferred database in the `application.properties` file.


ðŸ“š Database Overview

This project features a complex relational database designed to support a rich educational platform. The system uses Hibernate for ORM and includes the following key relationships:

    Users are generated and assigned

    Each user is enrolled in multiple Courses

    Each course contains several Lectures

    Each lecture includes Flashcards and Quizzes

    Quizzes are composed of multiple Questions

    Each question offers several Multiple Choice Answers

In addition to the entities listed above, the database includes even more interconnected entities to support advanced functionality and scalability.

You can view the full database structure in the attached image, which illustrates the depth and complexity of the schema. The actual entities are implemented using Hibernate in the project.

Update the database username and password in src/main/resources/application.yml:
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jwt_security
    username: your_db_username
    password: your_db_password
Running the Application

mvn clean install
Run the application:
mvn spring-boot:run
The application will start on http://localhost:8080.  
API Documentation
Swagger UI is available at:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Environment Variables
For sensitive information like API keys, you can use environment variables instead of hardcoding them in application.yml. Update the application.yml file to reference environment variables:

spring:
  mail:
    username: ${MAIL_USERNAME}
    password: ${MAIL_PASSWORD}



Set the environment variables in your system:

export MAIL_USERNAME=your_email
export MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
